Acknowledge & Investigate:

Acknowledge the alert or reported issue.
Review the logs immediately surrounding the ERR101 message to gather context. Note the transactionId, timestamp, and any accompanying stack traces or error messages from services like CreditTransactionService or CreditTransactionController.
Identify the specific data field(s) causing the "Bad Data" error if discernible from the logs (e.g., "Unable to get date from transaction date time field" as seen in application-2025-06-04.txt).
Raise Incident:

Based on the severity and impact (e.g., number of affected transactions, impact on critical functionality), raise an incident ticket in the designated incident management system (e.g., JIRA, PagerDuty, ServiceNow).
Populate the incident ticket with:
Error Code: ERR101 :: Bad Data
Timestamp of first occurrence.
Affected service(s) (e.g., transaction-service).
Sample transactionId(s) if available.
Relevant log snippets, including the ERR101 message and any stack traces.
Suspected source of the bad data if identifiable (e.g., specific upstream system or input channel).
Notify Relevant Teams:

Payments Gateway Team:
Notify the on-call Payments Gateway Team immediately via the established communication channel (e.g., dedicated Slack channel, direct message to on-call personnel).
Provide the incident ticket number and a brief summary of the issue, emphasizing that transaction-service is encountering bad data that might be originating from or affecting gateway operations.
Upstream Source(s):
If the investigation points to a specific upstream system or data provider as the source of the bad data, notify the relevant team(s) responsible for that source.
Provide them with the incident ticket number, examples of problematic data (if shareable), and timestamps.
Request them to investigate on their end and confirm if they are sending malformed data.
Monitor & Escalate:

Continuously monitor the logs for recurrence of the ERR101 error.
Update the incident ticket with any new findings or observations.
If the issue is widespread or causing significant service degradation, escalate the incident according to the defined escalation matrix.
