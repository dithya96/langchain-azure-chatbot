Good morning/afternoon, everyone. We're thrilled to present a GenAI-powered chatbot today, a tool designed to fundamentally change 
how our teams engage with and comprehend our company's diverse technology applications.

With our company's applications supported by teams across various geo-locations, 
responding to system events and issues presents a significant operational challenge. 
The need to coordinate across these distributed teams for manual analysis of source code, server logs, and disparate documentation often results in 
extended triage periods, consuming valuable developer and Run The Bank Support time delaying crucial fixes.

Architecture Overview

This GenAI chatbot system operates with a user-facing React UI that communicates with a Flask REST API hosted on Azure App Service.
The Flask backend serves responses generated by a Langchain-powered RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) process. 
This RAG process answers queries by leveraging a GPT-4o LLM (Azure Open AI) with context retrieved from a specialized vector database.
The vector database, built on Azure AI Search, is kept current through a synchronized data ingestion process. 
This process embeds diverse information sources: source code from Git (like the Java transaction service code we are working with), application logs from Azure Blob Storage, and documentation from SharePoint/Confluence.

Business Value

Accelerated Problem Resolution & Reduced Downtime
Enhanced Operational Efficiency for Distributed Teams: Breaks down knowledge barriers and streamlines troubleshooting for globally dispersed teams 
by providing a centralized, intelligent assistant that understands the intricacies of our applications

Risk and Control

To ensure responsible and secure operation of our GenAI chatbot, particularly when dealing with data from systems like the Transaction Service
example we have here, we've envisioned ways for robust risk controls. This includes using structured chat templates to strictly guide responses and 
prevent the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive customer-related data, alongside other comprehensive additional guardrails to maintain appropriate and secure interactions.
